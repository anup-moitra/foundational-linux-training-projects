### **⚖️ Step 4: Configure Installation Settings**

On the **Installation Summary** screen, review and adjust the following settings:

**🔧 Localization:**  
- **Language and Keyboard Layout**: Select the appropriate language and keyboard layout for the installation (e.g., English (India), English (India, with rupee)), and click **"Continue"**.
- **Date & Time**: Set the correct time zone for your region (e.g., Asia/Kolkata).
- **Language Support**: Ensure your preferred language is selected.

**🌄 Software:**  
- **Installation Source**: This is typically set to **Local Media** if the ISO file is attached. No changes are needed here.
- **Software Selection**:  
  - Choose **Server with GUI** if you need a graphical interface.  
  - Select **Minimal Install** for a lightweight server setup.

**🛠️ System:**  
- **Installation Destination**: Select the virtual hard disk created in the previous chapter. If needed, modify the partitioning options or leave the default **Automatic Partitioning**. Click **Done** to save.
- **KDUMP**: Leave this enabled unless you have specific requirements to disable it.
- **Network & Hostname**:  
  - Ensure the network adapter is enabled for internet access.
