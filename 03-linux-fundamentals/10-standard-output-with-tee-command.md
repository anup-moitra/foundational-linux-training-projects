### **üîë Introduction**  
The `tee` command in Linux is an essential tool that allows you to simultaneously display the output of a command and save it to a file. Think of it like a "T-splitter" in plumbing: it takes the output of a command and splits it in two‚Äîone path to your terminal (screen) and another path to a file. This is an improvement over the `>` operator, which only redirects output to a file without showing it on the screen.

As a beginner in Linux, mastering tools like `tee` is important for managing data streams and automating tasks efficiently. Whether you're working with logs, configuration files, or command output, the `tee` command will be a valuable addition to your toolkit.

### **üîç How the `tee` Command Works**

The `tee` command captures the output of a command and writes it to both the screen and one or more files. This enables you to keep track of output while also storing it for later use.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Simultaneous Output and File Storage**: View the command output on the screen and save it to a file at the same time.
- **Works with Pipes**: Use `tee` in conjunction with pipes (`|`) to capture and store the output of complex command pipelines.
- **Append Mode**: Use the `tee -a` option to append data to a file instead of overwriting it.

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage of `tee`**

To use `tee`, pipe the output of a command into it. For example, to echo a statement to both the screen and a file:

```bash
echo "Anup Moitra is learning cloud engineering" | tee cloud-engineer-info.txt
```

- This will display the text on the screen **and** save it to `cloud-engineer-info.txt`.

#### **Example: Viewing and Saving Output**
```bash
echo "Anup Moitra is learning cloud engineering" | tee cloud-engineer-info.txt
```
- Displays: "Anup Moitra is learning cloud engineering" on the screen.
- Saves the output to `cloud-engineer-info.txt`.

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Redirecting and Appending Output**

By default, `tee` overwrites the content of the file. However, you can append the output to an existing file by using the `-a` option.

#### **Example: Appending to a File**
```bash
echo "Anup is making progress with his Linux skills" | tee -a cloud-engineer-info.txt
```
- This appends "Anup is making progress with his Linux skills" to the file `cloud-engineer-info.txt` without erasing the previous content.

To verify the content:
```bash
cat cloud-engineer-info.txt
```
- Displays both lines in the file:
  - "Anup Moitra is learning cloud engineering"
  - "Anup is making progress with his Linux skills"

### **‚öôÔ∏è Using `tee` with Other Commands**

You can use `tee` with any command to capture its output while still displaying it on the screen. For instance, you can capture the output of the `ls` command and save it to a file.

#### **Example: Using `tee` with `ls`**
```bash
ls -l | tee directory-listing.txt
```
- Displays the directory listing on the screen.
- Saves the output to `directory-listing.txt`.

#### **Example: Using `tee` with Multiple Files**
```bash
ls -l | tee file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
- Saves the output of `ls -l` to `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt` simultaneously.

You can then use `cat` to check the contents of each file:
```bash
cat file1.txt
cat file2.txt
cat file3.txt
```

### **‚öôÔ∏è Viewing Help for `tee`**

To explore more options and usage examples for the `tee` command, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
tee --help
```
- This will display a list of available options for `tee`.

Some useful options include:
- `-a`: Appends output to a file instead of overwriting it.
- `-i`: Ignores interruptions, such as `Ctrl+C`.
- `--version`: Displays the version of the `tee` command installed.

### **üìÇ Practical Examples**

Here are some practical use cases for the `tee` command:

1. **Echo Output to a File**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, Cloud World!" | tee greeting.txt
   ```
   - Displays "Hello, Cloud World!" on the screen and saves it to `greeting.txt`.

2. **Append Output to a File**:
   ```bash
   echo "Anup is exploring cloud services" | tee -a cloud-engineer-info.txt
   ```
   - Appends "Anup is exploring cloud services" to `cloud-engineer-info.txt`.

3. **List Directory and Save Output**:
   ```bash
   ls -l | tee cloud-project-files.txt
   ```
   - Displays and saves the output of `ls -l` to `cloud-project-files.txt`.

4. **Display and Save Multiple Outputs**:
   ```bash
   echo "Cloud technologies are advancing rapidly" | tee cloud-tech1.txt cloud-tech2.txt
   ```
   - Saves "Cloud technologies are advancing rapidly" to both `cloud-tech1.txt` and `cloud-tech2.txt`.

### **‚úÖ Summary**

- The `tee` command allows you to **view** and **save** command output at the same time.
- **Appended Output**: Use `tee -a` to add data to an existing file without overwriting it.
- **Multi-File Output**: You can redirect output to multiple files at once.
- Mastering the `tee` command is valuable for anyone working with Linux, especially for tasks like logging, managing data streams, and automating processes.
