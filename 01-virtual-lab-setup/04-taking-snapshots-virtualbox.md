### **üñ•Ô∏è Introduction**  
In this chapter, we will explore the concept of **snapshots** in VirtualBox. Snapshots allow you to save the state of a virtual machine at a specific point in time, which is useful for testing, experimentation, and rollback scenarios.

### **üîß Step-by-Step Instructions**  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Snapshot Manager**  
- Open **VirtualBox** and select the virtual machine for which you want to take a snapshot.  
- Click on the **"Snapshots"** tab in the right-hand pane.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Take a Snapshot**  
- Click the **"Take Snapshot"** button (camera icon) or right-click on the current state and select **"Take Snapshot"**. üì∏  
- Provide a **name** and an **optional description** for the snapshot (e.g., *"Pre-Update Configuration"*).  
- Click **OK** to save the snapshot.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Restore a Snapshot**  
- Go to the **Snapshots** tab.  
- Right-click on the snapshot you want to restore and select **"Restore"**. üîÑ  
- Confirm the restoration process when prompted.  

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Delete a Snapshot**  
- Navigate to the **Snapshots** tab.  
- Right-click on the snapshot you want to delete and select **"Delete Snapshot"**. ‚ùå  
- Confirm the deletion.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Additional Tips**  
- Snapshots are not a replacement for full backups. They are ideal for short-term recovery points but should not be relied upon for long-term data protection.  
- Be aware that storing too many snapshots can consume significant disk space and impact system performance.  
- Regularly back up your virtual machines to ensure you have a secure copy of your data.

### **üìå Note**  
Snapshots are a powerful tool for virtual machine management. However, it‚Äôs important to manage them carefully to avoid cluttering your storage and negatively impacting system performance. üí°
