### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Linux?**  
In simple terms, **Linux** is a **free**, **open-source** operating system.  

‚úÖ **Free:** Linux can be downloaded, installed, and used without any cost. While some distributions (distros) may require paid support services, the core Linux system is completely free to use.  

‚úÖ **Open-Source:** The source code of Linux is publicly available, allowing developers to modify, improve, or tailor it to suit specific needs. This openness has led to the development of numerous Linux distributions, each designed to serve different user requirements.  

Although Linux shares similarities with other operating systems like **Windows** and **macOS**, it stands out for its **stability**, **security**, and **flexibility**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Linux Installation**  
Installing Linux is similar to installing other operating systems, but with more flexibility:  

1. **Starting the Installation Process:**  
   - When you power on a computer without an OS, it‚Äôs essentially non-functional (like a "brick").  
2. **Booting with Installation Media:**  
   - Instead of inserting a traditional **DVD** or **CD**, modern installations often rely on an **ISO image** ‚Äî a virtual disk image that initiates the installation process.  
3. **Completing the Setup:**  
   - During installation, you configure system settings like partitions, user accounts, and services.  
4. **Welcome to Linux!**  
   - After installation, you are greeted with the Linux terminal or desktop interface, ready to start using the system.
