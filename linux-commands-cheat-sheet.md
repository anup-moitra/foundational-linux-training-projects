## üîç **Finding Files and Directories**

### **Using the `find` Command**  
The `find` command allows you to search for files and directories based on various criteria.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash
find [path] [expression]
```

- `path`: Directory to start the search (e.g., `.` for the current directory).
- `expression`: Search criteria (e.g., `-name`).

#### **Examples:**

```bash
find . -name "filename"             # Search for a file by name
find /path/to/search -type d -name "dirname"   # Search for a directory
sudo find / -name "filename"        # Search from the root directory
```

### **Using the `locate` Command**  
The `locate` command quickly searches for a file by referencing a pre-built database.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash
locate filename
```

#### **Examples:**

```bash
locate filename                     # Quickly search for a file
sudo updatedb                       # Update the database for accurate results
```

### **Key Differences: `find` vs `locate`**

| Feature              | `find`                              | `locate`                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Speed**            | Real-time, slower                   | Faster (uses a database)        |
| **Customization**    | Highly flexible search criteria     | Limited to filenames            |
| **Database Required**| No                                  | Yes                             |
| **Requires Update**  | No                                  | Yes (with `updatedb`)           |

## üåü **Wildcards in Linux**

Wildcards help match patterns in filenames and simplify tasks like searching, copying, and deleting files.

### **Types of Wildcards**

#### **`*` (Asterisk)** ‚Äì Matches Any Number of Characters  
Use the asterisk to match any sequence of characters.

```bash
ls ABC*       # Lists files starting with "ABC"
rm ABC*       # Deletes files starting with "ABC"
```


#### **`?` (Question Mark)** ‚Äì Matches Exactly One Character  
Use the question mark to match a single character.

```bash
ls A?.txt     # Matches files like A1.txt, A2.txt
```


#### **`{}` (Curly Braces)** ‚Äì Creates Sequences or Multiple Options  
Use curly braces to create a sequence of files or specify multiple options.

```bash
touch file{1..5}.txt     # Creates file1.txt to file5.txt
```


#### **`[]` (Square Brackets)** ‚Äì Matches One Character from a Set  
Use square brackets to match one character from a specified set.

```bash
ls file[A-C]*   # Matches fileA.txt, fileB.txt, fileC.txt
```

```

#### **`cat`** ‚Äì View the Content of the File or Link  
If the source file is deleted, the soft link will result in an error when you try to view its content.

```bash
cat <link_name>                    # View content of the soft link
```

### **Hard Links**

#### **`ln`** ‚Äì Create a Hard Link to a File  
Both the source file and the hard link share the same inode. The content remains accessible even if the original file is deleted.

```bash
ln <source_file> <link_name>       # Create a hard link
```

#### **`ls -li`** ‚Äì View Inode Information for Files and Links  
Both the source file and the hard link will have the same inode number.

```bash
ls -li                             # View inode of the hard link (same as source file)
```

#### **`cat`** ‚Äì View the Content of the Hard Link  
The content of the hard link remains accessible even if the original file is deleted.

```bash
cat <link_name>                    # View content of the hard link
```

## üî¢ **chmod Command - File Permissions Using Numeric Mode**

### **Understanding Numeric Mode**

#### **Permission Types:**

- **No Permission:** `0` (---)
- **Execute:** `1` (--x)
- **Write:** `2` (-w-)
- **Write + Execute:** `3` (-wx)
- **Read:** `4` (r--)
- **Read + Execute:** `5` (r-x)
- **Read + Write:** `6` (rw-)
- **Read + Write + Execute:** `7` (rwx)

### **Structure of Numeric Permissions**

- **User (Owner):** First digit
- **Group:** Second digit
- **Others (Everyone):** Third digit

#### **Formula:**  
Add values for the desired permissions (e.g., Read = 4, Write = 2, Execute = 1)

### **Examples:**

#### **Assign `rwx` to Owner, `rw` to Group, and `r` to Others:**

```bash
chmod 764 filename
```
- **Owner:** `rwx = 7`
- **Group:** `rw- = 6`
- **Others:** `r-- = 4`
- **Output:** `-rwxrw-r-- filename`

#### **Remove All Permissions:**

```bash
chmod 000 filename
```
- **Owner, Group, Others:** `--- = 0`
- **Output:** `---------- filename`

#### **Assign `rw` to the Owner, and No Permissions to Group and Others:**

```bash
chmod 600 filename
```
- **Owner:** `rw- = 6`
- **Group, Others:** `--- = 0`
- **Output:** `-rw------- filename`

#### **Assign `rw` to Owner, and `r` to Others:**

```bash
chmod 604 filename
```
- **Owner:** `rw- = 6`
- **Group:** `--- = 0`
- **Others:** `r-- = 4`
- **Output:** `-rw----r-- filename`

#### **Assign Execute to Everyone:**

```bash
chmod 111 filename
```
- **Owner, Group, Others:** `--x = 1`
- **Output:** `--x--x--x filename`

#### **Assign `r-x` to Owner, Group, and Others:**

```bash
chmod 555 filename
```
- **Owner:** `r-x = 5`
- **Group:** `r-x = 5`
- **Others:** `r-x = 5`
- **Output:** `-r-xr-xr-x filename`

### **Using Online Tools**

You can use online `chmod` calculators to generate numeric values for desired permissions.  
These tools visualize the permission combinations and their corresponding numeric values, making it easier to understand and set the correct permissions.

## üë• **`chown` and `chgrp` Commands - Managing File Ownership**Ô∏è

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`chown` Command** 

#### **Purpose:**  
Change the owner (and optionally the group) of a file or directory.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash
chown [OPTION] OWNER[:GROUP] FILE
```
- **OWNER:** The new owner.
- **GROUP (Optional):** The new group.
- **FILE:** The file or directory.

#### **Common Options:**
- **-R:** Apply changes recursively.
- **-v:** Verbose output.

#### **Examples:**

##### **Change both owner and group:**

```bash
chown -v user1:group1 filename
```
**Output:**  
`changed ownership of 'filename' from user2:group2 to user1:group1`

##### **Change only the owner:**

```bash
chown -v user1 filename
```
**Output:**  
`changed ownership of 'filename' from user2 to user1`

##### **Change only the group:**

```bash
chown -v :group1 filename
```
**Output:**  
`changed group of 'filename' from group2 to group1`

##### **Recursively change ownership:**

```bash
chown -R user1:group1 /path/to/directory
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`chgrp` Command** 

#### **Purpose:**  
Change the group ownership of a file or directory.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash
chgrp [OPTION] GROUP FILE
```
- **GROUP:** The new group.
- **FILE:** The file or directory.

#### **Common Options:**
- **-R:** Apply changes recursively.
- **-v:** Verbose output.

#### **Examples:**

##### **Change group ownership:**

```bash
chgrp -v group1 filename
```
**Output:**  
`changed group of 'filename' from group2 to group1`

##### **Recursively change group ownership:**

```bash
chgrp -v -R group1 /path/to/directory
```
**Output:**  
`changed group of '/path/to/directory/file1' from group2 to group1`

##### **Change group ownership for multiple files:**

```bash
chgrp -v group1 file1 file2 file3
```
**Output:**  
`changed group of 'file1' from group2 to group1`

### üìö **Verifying Ownership Changes**

Use `ls -l` to verify ownership:

```bash
ls -l filename
```
**Output:**

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user1 group1 1234 Dec 22 12:00 filename
```
- **user1** is the owner.
- **group1** is the group.

### üîÑ **Combining Commands, Options, and Arguments**

You can use `chown` and `chgrp` with options to modify ownership recursively or make changes efficiently.

### üí° **Key Points**
- **`chown`:** Changes owner and optionally the group.
- **`chgrp`:** Changes the group only.
- Only **root** or users with **elevated privileges** can use `chown`.
- Regular users can use **`chgrp`** if they own the file and belong to the target group.
- Use the **-R** option to apply changes recursively.
- **Verify changes** with `ls -l`.

### üîç **Additional Tips**

#### **Using `sudo`:**
For non-root users with administrative privileges, prepend `sudo` to execute commands:

```bash
sudo chown user1:group1 filename
```

#### **Manual Pages:**
Use `man` to learn more about `chown` and `chgrp` options:

```bash
man chown
man chgrp
```

## üîë **Key Commands for ACL (Access Control List)** 

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`setfacl` Command** - Set or Modify ACL Entries

#### **Purpose:**  
Used to set or modify Access Control List (ACL) entries for files and directories.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash
setfacl [OPTION] ENTRY FILE
```

#### **Examples:**

##### **Grant permissions to a user:**

```bash
setfacl -m u:<username>:<permissions> <file>
```
Example:
```bash
setfacl -m u:user1:rw file.txt
```
This grants **read and write** permissions to `user1` on `file.txt`.

##### **Grant permissions to a group:**

```bash
setfacl -m g:<groupname>:<permissions> <file>
```
Example:
```bash
setfacl -m g:developers:r file.txt
```
This grants **read** permission to the group `developers` on `file.txt`.

##### **Apply permissions recursively to a directory:**

```bash
setfacl -R -m u:<username>:<permissions> <directory>
```
Example:
```bash
setfacl -R -m u:user1:rw /data
```
This grants **read and write** permissions to `user1` for all files in the `/data` directory.

##### **Remove a specific ACL entry:**

```bash
setfacl -x u:<username> <file>
```
Example:
```bash
setfacl -x u:user1 file.txt
```
This **removes** the ACL entry for `user1` on `file.txt`.

##### **Remove all ACL entries:**

```bash
setfacl -b <file>
```
Example:
```bash
setfacl -b file.txt
```
This **removes all ACL entries** from `file.txt`.

##### **Set ACL inheritance for a directory:**

```bash
setfacl -m d:u:<username>:<permissions> <directory>
```
Example:
```bash
setfacl -m d:u:user1:rw /data
```
This **sets default ACLs** for `user1` to **read and write** in the `/data` directory and any new files created inside it.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`getfacl` Command** - View ACL Entries

#### **Purpose:**  
Used to view the ACL entries of a file or directory.

#### **Syntax:**

```bash

## üîÑ **Input and Output Redirection**

### **`>`** ‚Äì Redirect Standard Output to a File  
Use this command to redirect the output of a command to a file, overwriting its contents.

```bash
command > file             # Redirect standard output to a file, overwriting its contents
ls -l > output.txt         # Save the output of `ls -l` into `output.txt`, overwriting if exists
```

### **`>>`** ‚Äì Append Standard Output to a File  
Use the `>>` operator to append the output of a command to a file without overwriting its existing contents.

```bash
command >> file            # Append standard output to a file
ls -la >> output.txt       # Append the output of `ls -la` to `output.txt`
```

### **`<`** ‚Äì Redirect Standard Input from a File  
Use this command to feed a file's contents as input to a command.

```bash
command < file             # Feed input from a file to a command
cat < output.txt           # Display the contents of `output.txt` using `cat`
```

### **`2>`** ‚Äì Redirect Standard Error to a File  
Use `2>` to redirect error messages (stderr) to a file.

```bash
command 2> file            # Redirect standard error to a file
ls /invalidpath 2> error.txt # Save error messages to `error.txt`
```

### **`2>&1`** ‚Äì Combine Standard Output and Standard Error  
Use this command to combine both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) into a single stream, usually redirected to a file.

```bash
command > file 2>&1        # Combine stdout and stderr, redirecting both to a file
ls -l /root > combined.txt 2>&1 # Save both output and errors to `combined.txt`
```

## üîÑ **Redirecting and Viewing Output with `tee`**

### **`tee`** ‚Äì Simultaneously Display and Save Output  
The `tee` command allows you to display the output of a command on the terminal while saving it to a file. By default, it overwrites the content of the file, but it can also append output using the `-a` option.

```bash
command | tee filename               # Display and save output to a file
command | tee -a filename            # Append output to an existing file
command | tee file1 file2            # Save output to multiple files
```

#### **Examples**:
- **View and Save Output**:  
   ```bash
   echo "Learning Linux is fun!" | tee output.txt
   ```
   Displays: `Learning Linux is fun!`  
   Saves the output to `output.txt`.

- **Append to a File**:  
   ```bash
   echo "This is appended text." | tee -a output.txt
   ```
   Adds `This is appended text.` to the existing `output.txt`.

- **Capture Output of a Command**:  
   ```bash
   ls -l | tee directory-listing.txt
   ```
   Displays the directory listing on the terminal and saves it to `directory-listing.txt`.

- **Save to Multiple Files**:  
   ```bash
   echo "Linux is powerful!" | tee linux1.txt linux2.txt
   ```
   Saves the same output to both `linux1.txt` and `linux2.txt`.

```bash
command | more               # Display output one page at a time
```

#### **Examples**:
- **View Long Directory Listings**:  
   ```bash
   ls -l | more
   ```
   Displays the output of `ls -l` one page at a time.

- **View Detailed Directory Listings**:  
   ```bash
   ll | more
   ```
   Displays the detailed directory listing (`ll` is an alias for `ls -l` in many Linux systems) one page at a time.


### **`tail`** ‚Äì View the Last Part of the Output  
The `tail` command displays the last part of the output, typically useful for viewing the end of files, logs, or outputs from long-running processes.

```bash
command | tail               # Display the last 10 lines (default)
command | tail -n 20         # Display the last 20 lines
```

#### **Examples**:
- **View the Last 10 Entries of a Directory Listing**:  
   ```bash
   ls -l | tail
   ```
   Displays the last 10 lines of the directory listing.

- **View the Last 20 Entries of a Detailed Directory Listing**:  
   ```bash
   ll | tail -n 20
   ```
   Displays the last 20 lines of the detailed directory listing.


### **`head`** ‚Äì View the First Part of the Output  
The `head` command displays the first part of the output, typically useful when you want to view the initial lines of files or command results.

```bash
command | head               # Display the first 10 lines (default)
command | head -n 5          # Display the first 5 lines
```

#### **Examples**:
- **View the First 10 Entries of a Directory Listing**:  
   ```bash
   ls -l | head
   ```
   Displays the first 10 lines of the directory listing.

- **View the First 5 Entries of a Detailed Directory Listing**:  
   ```bash
   ll | head -n 5
   ```
   Displays the first 5 lines of the detailed directory listing.


### **Combining `more`, `tail`, and `head` with Pipes**

You can combine these commands with pipes to view and manipulate outputs in more specific ways.

#### **Examples**:
- **View the First 20 Entries of a Directory Listing, Then Scroll Through the Rest**:  
   ```bash
   ls -l | head -n 20 | more
   ```
   Displays the first 20 lines of the directory listing and allows you to scroll through the rest.

- **View the Last 10 Entries and Pipe to `more` for Scrolling**:  
   ```bash
   ls -l | tail | more
   ```
   Displays the last 10 lines of the directory listing and allows you to scroll through the output.
